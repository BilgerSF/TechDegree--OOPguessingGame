# Phrase Hunter Game App
Interactive JavaScript guessing game created by applying object-oriented programming paradigm. The app includes three classes that contain the corresponding methods and properties as a blueprint for the instantiated objects. The instantiation of this classes allows an easy management of the game such as creating new games and adding multiple functionalities in a organized and scalable manner.

# Game Description
The game allows users to select letters from a virtual keyboard by simply clicking on the keys, if there is a match then the matched letter(s) are displayed otherwise the letters wonâ€™t be displayed causing the user too loose one life. The pressed keys get disabled on each click and change color if there is a match or not, and finally if the user guesses all the letters then the user wins, otherwise loses.


# Phrase Class
 - Includes constructor that receives a `phrase` parameter and initializes a `phrase`
property set to the phrase
- Includes `addPhraseToDisplay()` method which displays the phrase on the
gameboard
- Includes `checkLetter()` method which checks if a letter is in the phrase
- Includes `showMatchedLetter()` method which reveals the letter(s) on the board that
matches the player's selection

# Game Class 
- Includes a constructor that initializes a `missed` property set to `0`, a `phrases`
property set to an array of five Phrase objects, and an `activePhrase` property set to
`null` initially
Includes `startGame()` method that hides the start screen overlay, sets the
`activePhrase` property to a random phrase, and calls the `addPhraseToDisplay()`
method on the active phrase
- Includes `getRandomPhrase()` method that randomly retrieves one phrase from the
`phrases` array
- Includes `handleInteraction()` method that:
 If the phrase does **not** include the guessed letter, the `wrong` CSS class is
added to the selected letter's keyboard button and the `removeLife()` method
is called
- If the phrase includes the guessed letter, the `chosen` CSS class is added to
the selected letter's keyboard button, the `showMatchedLetter()` method is
called on the phrase, and the `checkForWin()` method is called. If the player
has won the game, the `gameOver()` method is called

- Includes `checkForWin()` method that checks if the player has revealed all of the
letters in the active phrase
- Includes a `removeLife()` method that removes a life from the scoreboard (one of the
`liveHeart.png` images is replaced with a `lostHeart.png` image), increments the
`missed` property, and if the player has lost the game calls the `gameOver()` method
- Includes `gameOver()` method that displays a final "win" or "loss" message by
showing the original start screen overlay styled with either the `win` or `lose` CSS
class

# app.js
- Clicking the "Start Game" button creates a new `Game` object and starts the game
- Clicking an onscreen keyboard button results in a call to the `handleInteraction()`
method for the clicked keyboard button
- Clicking the spaces between and around the onscreen keyboard buttons does not
result in the `handleInteraction()` method being called

# Reseting the Gameboard
- After a game is completed, the gameboard is reset so that clicking the "Start Game"
button loads a new game
